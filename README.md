# Review

Hy!

In this repo I will summarise my thoughts, feelings, methods, findings in the cybersecurity field. I will try to write short and compact descriptions about IT security terms, vulnerabilities, attack types to be able to understand more easily for beginners.
During the research work I am planning to learn and usderstand these topics myself as well.

You might find here other useful writings, like WriteUps for retired HTB boxes, or useful link collections to learn and dig deeper into technical things, privileges escalation methods, codes.

ATTENTION: I am still learning, these writings represents my understanding of topics, I might think things wrong or don't uderstand fully, be aware!

If you have any advices or questions feel free to contact me here in Github.
