# Review

Hy!

In this repo I will summarise my thoughts, feelings, methods, findings in the cybersecurity field. I will try to write short and compact descriptions about IT security terms, vulnerabilities, attack types to be able to understand more easily for beginners.
During the research work I am planning to learn and usderstand these topics myself as well.

If you have any advices or questions feel free to contact me here in Github.
